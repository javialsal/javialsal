<br>
After 6 years of experience MarCom positions, I now wish to acquire technical skills to complete my <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/javialsal/"> marketing and communication background</a></strong>.
That is why I decided to join <strong><a href="https://github.com/lewagon">Le Wagon </a></strong>in April 2023 to learn how to code, get to know the tech ecosystem and face new challenges!
<li> ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for a team to keep learning and contribute on making internet a cooler and better place.</li>
